Note: For the slides from the GDC portal, we divided them into the tumor or normal tissues according to the label named “sample_type_id”, where “1” is the tumor and “11” represents normal tissues. Similarly, the histopathological grade based on the label named “neoplasm_histologic_grade” (High-level = well-differentiated (G1); medium = moderate-differentiated (G2); Notably, the low-level consisting of undifferentiation (G4) and low-differentiation (G3) in our study) and gene mutation information is from the gene report.<br/>
